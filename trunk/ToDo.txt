												=== Structure prototype ===

createEnvironment() 			= check ".exe" for testing program and checker (may be std::%checkerName%)
								= create directory for invocation
								= copy all data to that directory (tests will be copied one by one just before invocation on that test)

runTesting()					= obvious :) A lot to do

clearEnvironment()				= delete all data of invocation and remove directory

outputInfo()					= output all invocation info: timePeak, memoryPeak, verdict (comment if exists)
