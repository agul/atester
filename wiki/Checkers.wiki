ATester supports checkers (validating programs).

Checkers should follow ATester Checker Format:
 * Checkers should use ONLY 4 files: *test.in* - test input; *test.out* - test output; *output.txt* - program output; *check.log* - checker log.
 * Checker should return result in checker log file - *check.log*. Actually, answers are simple: *OK* - program output is correct; *WA* - program output is wrong or format is invalid.
 * Time Limit for all checkers is 10 seconds.
 * There is no memory limit for checkers.
 * If checker does not return result/checker log is not equal to *OK* or *WA*/checker time limit exceeded/checker exit code was not equal to zero then ATester will return *Checker Error* status of testing. 

Also, ATester can work with Testlib checkers. BUT, you should download modified version of Testlib (all function are similar, but writing report is different).
